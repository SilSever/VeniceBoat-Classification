# VeniceBoat-Classification

This is a simple homework for Machine Learning course at Sapienza University of Rome.

For this homework I've used MarDCT Dataset. You can check this at this link: http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~labrococo/MAR/index.htm

Please cite this if you use this dataset:

	title = {{ARGOS-V}enice Boat Classification},
	booktitle = "Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS), 2015 12th IEEE International Conference on",
	year = "2015",
	pages = "1--6",
	doi={10.1109/AVSS.2015.7301727}
}
```

## Goals

The aim of this homework is to classify both the kinds of boats that sailed on the Venice Grand Canal and its families too. You can check the first classification on boat-classification.py file, while the second one on family-classification.py.

## Tools
I've used two kinds of CNN's, a SmalleVGGNet and a VGG_16. In the end, I have also compared the training results.

Please cite this if you use the VGG_16 net:
